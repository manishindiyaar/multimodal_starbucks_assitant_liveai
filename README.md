The way it works is simple. You just need to provide it with a voice command, and it will process your voice and then call the class and class is being used to control entire UI just we have to play with class and these classes are being written by our Realtime Speech2Speech LLM by function calling like for that we are using ```fixie-ai/ultravox-70```.
